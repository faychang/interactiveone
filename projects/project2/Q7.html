			I’m hoping to finalize a personal project I started years ago in college but never fully finished (it was finished for the purpose of the project, but not something I could put out into the world commercially). It’s a board game, and I’d love to tell you more but I’d prefer to finish it properly before I say too much about it. I also hope to write more in 2014. I love writing, but the process of doing so is difficult for me as I wasn’t formally trained as a writer and don’t have a very smooth process of draft to final. It takes me a long time and I agonize over the tone of voice and my choice of words so that it feels as natural as can be.
