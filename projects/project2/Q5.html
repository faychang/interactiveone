			There’s so much I love about seeing my work in print. It’s magical to be able to run your fingers over the printed texture of something you created digitally, especially when special printing techniques are used. There’s something that happens in the translation from digital to print that just adds an extra layer of specialness that is really hard to achieve digitally. I also love the finality of it—when it’s printed, you can’t open up the file and fuss with it, endlessly replacing and upgrading the images like you can for a web project. ‘The ink never dries on the web’ is something I heard said once and there’s something really nice about being able to truly conclude a project and move on to something new.
