 				<p>
 				I love solving problems, I love helping others with the skills that I have, and I just love the whole process of making things—coming up with ideas, roughing out sketches, tightening up sketches, drawing in illustrator and making endless tweaks. it’s all very meditative for me and I’m probably the least stressed out when I can just spend days drawing / designing. as far as other compulsions, I’ve recently started exercising regularly (about a year ago I started doing pilates three times a week and have since integrated yoga into my schedule). I definitely find that exercise helps me manage stress and keeps me focussed when I’m working. plus I really like to eat, so if I exercise I feel way better about downing a giant pulled pork sandwich for dinner.
