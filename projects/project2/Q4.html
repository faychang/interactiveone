 			Every project that I work on gives me satisfaction in new ways. When I worked on the titles for Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom, I was so proud and excited about the end result and just so happy to be able to be a part of something so big. That said, I didn’t have as much authorship with that project as I do with other smaller projects (when you work with someone like Wes, he has a vision and it’s your job to carry it out), so all the work I take on helps to create a balance of satisfaction.
