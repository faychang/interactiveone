 				<p>
 				I draw a lot for client projects but don’t do a lot of drawing for fun. I think being able to draw can be important as a designer because it’s a means of communication, but if you have other ways of sharing ideas in the early stages of a project that also work, then great. Personally I find that pencil sketches are a great way to begin a project and because it’s obviously far from the finished piece, clients give less pushback. The closer to final your roughs are, the more revisions you tend to have to do, I’ve found.
